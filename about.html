        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jose Rocha, an aspiring software developer based in Seattle, WA. My journey into tech started with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving, which I’ve nurtured through both formal education and hands-on experience.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve worked in diverse roles, from maintaining operations in property management to honing my skills in web development and technical support. My career has been driven by a desire to improve organizational performance and deliver high-quality services. I’m particularly skilled in website development, system architecture, and mobile app development.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I’m fluent in both Spanish and English, and I thrive in collaborative environments where teamwork is key to success. I’m always eager to learn and adapt, constantly seeking out new challenges that allow me to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
        
        <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest in gaming, urban dance, or engaging in other creative endeavors. I believe in balancing work with play and always strive to bring enthusiasm and creativity to everything I do.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
